## In this step you will:

 * Add the dashboard component to your app in the [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center] This is where the site owner will see your call to the
 app instance API
 
 


    

## Add a dashboard component to your app in the Wix Developers Center
-   Go to your app [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]
-   Look for the `Components` page on the left sidebar and click `Add Component`, choose `Dashboard Component`. It should look like:

    ![wix development site](../images/add-component.jpg?raw=true)
-   If you already started your server you will see in the terminal the `app dashboard link:` copy it and set it to be the `iFrame URL` of the `Dashboard Page`
    And click `Save`, It should look like this:

    ![wix development site](../images/dashboard-new.jpg?raw=true)

Use [Use Wix API Docs][wix-docs] to add permission to the app in the [Wix Developer Center][wix-dev-center]:
